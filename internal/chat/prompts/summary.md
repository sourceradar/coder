Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close
attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions. This summary should
be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions
that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Focus only on the key points, technical details, and important decisions made
The summary should be factual and neutral, highlighting the main topics discussed,
code concepts explained, and solutions proposed

Ignore any casual conversation or pleasantries.

Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Intent: the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Context: list of what's going on, documenting problems solved and any ongoing
   troubleshooting efforts. Enumerate specific files and code sections examined,
   modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages.
3. Actions: the actions you took in response to the user's requests.
   Do not include code snippets
4. Current state: the current state of the project, including a brief summary of what
   you did so far. Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request,
   paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant.
5. Next Steps: list the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing.
   Ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's explicit requests,
   and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request.

Here's an example how your output should be structured:
